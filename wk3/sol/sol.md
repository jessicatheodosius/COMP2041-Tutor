### COMP2041 Week 3 Tutorial

### Question 1

- problem: you might not have the current directory in your PATH
- solution: add . to the end of your PATH (via PATH=$PATH:.) or type the command name as ./myScript
- problem: the myScript file might not be executable
- solution: make the file executable (via chmod +x myScript)
    or execute it via the command sh myScript (also fixes the first problem)
- problem: you might have gotten the #!/bin/sh line wrong
- solution: check the line to make sure there are no spurious spaces or spelling mistakes and then check that the shell is actually called /bin/sh on your system
- problem: the myScript file has been transferred from a Windows-based computer in binary mode, and there's a ^M ('\\r' in the C context) after /bin/sh
- solution: run the standard command dos2unix MyScript which will remove the pesky ^Ms.


### Question 2

No, we need to sort it based on family name field, but every person has different number of initials. One possibility is to make family name as first field.

### Question 3

a. `head -3 /etc/passwd`  
b. `egrep '^(cs|se|bi|en)[0-9]' /etc/passwd`  
c. `grep '/bin/bash' passwd | cut -d':' -f1`  
d. `cut -d':' -f1,2 passwd | tr ':' '\t' > passwords.txt`

## Shell Variables

- $0 the name of the command
- $1 the first command-line argument
- $2 the second command-line argument
- $3 the third command-line argument
- $# count of command-line arguments
- $* all of the command-line arguments (together)
- $@ all of the command-line arguments (separately)
- $? exit status of the most recent command
- $$ process ID of this shell


- single-quote (’) grouping, turns off all transformations
- double-quote (") grouping, no transformations except $ and ‘
- backquote (‘) no grouping, capture command results

`quotes.sh`

### Before Anything Else

- wildcard in `*, ?, []`
- talk about test
- talk about `expr.sh`
- talk about `arg1.sh arg2.sh`

### Question 4

- the script doesn't concatenate files named on the command line,  just standard input
- it doesn't implement all of the cat options (e.g. no -m)
- the appearance of lines may be altered (space at start of line is removed, and runs of multiple spaces will be compressed to a single space)


```
#!/bin/sh -x    for debugging
test -r "$f" or [ -r "$f" ]
-r test if readable
man test
```

```
#!/bin/sh -x
for f in "$@"
do
    if [ ! -r "$f" ]
    then
        echo "No such file: $f"
    else
        while read line
        do
            echo "$line"
        done <$f
    fi
done
```

### Question 5

```
#!/bin/sh

for f in "$@"
do
    echo "==== `echo $f | sed 's/\.txt//'` ===="
    cat "$f"
done
```

### Question 6

```
#!/bin/sh

while read zid name init
do
    mark=`grep $zid Marks | cut -d' ' -f2`
    echo "$mark $name $init"
done
```

```
sort -n students | join marks - | cut -d' ' -f2,4,5 | sort -k2
```

### Question 7

```
#!/bin/sh
while read stid mark extras
do
    case "$mark" in
    [0-9]*) ;;
    *)      echo "$stid ?? ($mark)"
            continue
            ;;
    esac

    if test $mark -lt 50
    then
        echo $stid FL
    elif test $mark -le 100
    then
        echo $stid HD
    else
        echo "$stid ?? ($mark)"
    fi
done
```

### Question 8

```
#!/bin/sh

current_month=`date | cut -c8-10`

while test "$current_month = `date | cut -c8-10`"
do
    date
    sleep 5
done
```

### Question 9

```
wc -l *.tex             // different lines
echo `wc -l *.tex`      // make it in one line, no difference in content
```

### Question 10

```
#!/bin/sh

LIMIT=50

for f in *
do
    if test -d "$f"
    then
        continue
    fi

    count=`wc -c < "$f"`
    if [ $count -gt $LIMIT ]
    then    
        echo "$f"
    fi
done
```

### Question 11

```
-d deletes space
-c complement
-s squeeze multiple occurrences to one
```

a. 2  
b. 11  
c. `  4 BIG
      1 BUT
      2 IS
      1 NOT
      1 SO
      2 THIS`

replaces not alphanumeric to new line, and squeeze all consecutive new lines with just one

### Question 13

a. a b c  
b. a&nbsp;&nbsp;b&nbsp;&nbsp;c  
c. Y Y  
d. x2  
e.  
f. Y Y  
g. $y       `single quotes prevent expansion`  
h. Y: command not found  
i. a b c  
j. a b c
